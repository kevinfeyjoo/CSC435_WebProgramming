Roast Duck Recipe Page:

The next part is to create a specific recipe page of a roasted duck.
The HTML is stored in a file called duck.html. Unlike index.html, this
page must match exactly of the appearance of the specific webpage
(screen shot) attached to this homework.
The width of the screenshot below is based on a browser window width
of 1024px (approximately); if your screen is a different size, the
width of your page may not exactly match. (Firefox's Web Developer
Toolbar add-on can help you resize your browser to any dimension;
you could use 1024x768 to compare the images.)
