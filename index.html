<div class="about">
  <h1>Who am I? And why do I care?</h1>
  <p>I am an example of all the millions of people who fall for the "American Dream." The system shows us to put a huge emphasis on school in our lives
    but it doesn't teach us to be financially responsible adults. Instead, society tells us its ok to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on a degree 
    that might not guarantee the expected results. 

    I want people to know that college isn't bad. College is for people who know what they want out of a degree. It is better to invest in yourself and follow
    something you are passionate about while saving money to create generational wealth to fight against debt slavery.
