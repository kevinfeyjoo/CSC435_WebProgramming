Index Page:

The first part of your task is to create a creative page of your choosing,
stored in a file named index.html. It could be a homepage of a recipe website or your own webpage.
Your page must contain at least one link. The file must also be at least 20 lines long and must
contain at least 5 different HTML elements in its body. It also may not significantly borrow
content from your duck.html. Otherwise, this page can have any appearance you like. If you
like, you may use an optional CSS file with this page named index.css and submit it with
your other files. Be creative! We may show some students' pages in class.
