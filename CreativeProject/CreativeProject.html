<h1> Creative Project </h1>
<a href="https://kevinfeyjoo.github.io/CSC435_WebProgramming/CreativeProject/index.html">Home</a>

<h4>CSC 435 Spring 18</h4>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Throughout this course, we'll work with a number of different technologies to build different pieces of web applications.

However, it can be de-motivating to build something to a specification, especially when you are learning
something new and want to make something that has your own flavor. To give you a chance to play around with
the technologies we're learning, this semester one of your homework assignments will be to write one or more websites
from scratch, entirely of your own design. Every two weeks, there will be some requirements that you have to meet,
but the requirements don't force you to have any particular content, layout, color scheme, feel, etc - you'll make
that yourself.
</p>
<p>
The idea is that you spend around an hour each week. This should be ample time to meet the specified requirements
for the week. If you find yourself spending much, much more than one hour per week, talk to your TA
or the instructor, and we'll make sure that the time you spend in your creative project doesn't prevent you from
getting other coursework done.
</p>
<p>
Each week you can decide if you want to build on one of your previous creative projects or start an entirely new one.
Just make sure that you fulfill the requirements of the week (you don't need to meet the previous week's requirements).</p>


<h2>Example Project Ideas</h2>

<p>
If you don't have inspiration for your own project, one suggestion is to build online experiment user interface to collect user responses. Such interface is critical for companies to gauge consumer interests. For example, you can show the user an image (e.g. a online fasion photo) and ask them to select a category of the garment by clicking on image icons of similar images with labels (e.g. wrap coat, A-line coat, Jacket, Woolcoat,Trench coat, etc).  The experiment can have multiple trials. The website can have instructions and tutorials. Eventually, you can use online image database to generate the images and collect user responses in a efficient way. In addition, you can learn how to interact with server side scripts to save the data as well as visualize the data in real time.  Finally, you can host the experiment on crowd-sourcing service such as Amazon Mechanical Turk. This is a very under explored field and might be very useful to share your final project on Github.

<p>To get inspirations, you can explore <a href="https://www.mturk.com">Amazon Mechanical Turk's HITs</a>. You can sign in as a worker and explore what are some of the crowd-sourcing experiments out there. </p>

</p>

<p>
Another idea is to build a personal portofolio. This is a type of online showcase of your work. You can link into art projects, papers that you are proud of, etc. At the end of the quarter, you'll be able to share this portfolio with, well, anyone with an Internet connection :)

</li>
<li> Use <code>document.getElementById</code> or <code>document.querySelector</code> or <code>document.querySelectorAll</code> to select

your page using a JavaScript function(s) in your <code>.js</code> file </li>

</li>
<li> The view switching should be handled by javascript code in a <code>.js</code> file.

</li>
</ul>

<h2>Week #2 Requirements</h2>
        <h5>Due Feb 20, Tuesday </h5>
        Again, you can start with a new project or you can still modify the content of your project from Week1. We will evaluate this week's milesones independently from the previous one. However, this time you must make sure your code pass the <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">HTML validator</a> and <a href="http://www.css-validator.org/">W3C CSS validator</a> and bug free. If errors are found, ponints will be reduced.
<ul>
<li>
Your webpage must have at least 2 different HTML pages and you must link to the other from <code>index.html</code>
</li>
<li> You must add an <code>id</code> attribute to at least 3 different elements, and a <code>class</code> attribute to at least 7 different
elements. Howver, think though the DOM and avoid using unnecessary elements </li>
<li> CSS Selectors: Use 3 different contextual CSS selectors in your css files
(examples: ul p { ... }, ul > p { ... }). </li>
<li> CSS Selectors: Use ids or classes in 3 different selectors in your CSS files (example: #unique { ... }).</li>
<li> From this projct onward, we will try to write concise and efficient CSS.

</ul>

<h2>Week #1 Requirements</h2>
<h5>Due Feb 2, Friday</h5>
